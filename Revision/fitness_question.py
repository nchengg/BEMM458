# Question 4 – Classes (Revised)
# A community sports centre is managing its weekly fitness sessions.
#
# Create a `FitnessSession` class.
#
# 1. Attributes: `session_name`, `capacity`, `current_attendees`.
# 2. Method `add_attendees(self, number)` increases attendees (not above capacity).
# 3. Method `remove_attendees(self, number)` decreases attendees (not below zero).
# 4. Create two sessions (e.g., "Yoga Flow", "Strength Circuit"). Add and remove attendees.
# 5. Print a summary of both sessions using a custom __str__() method.
# 6. Comment why classes are helpful for managing multiple fitness sessions in a sports centre.
