# Question 3 – Functions (Revised)
# A local sports club is tracking weekly training distances (in km) for its runners.
#
# distances = [12, 18, 10, 15, 22, 25, 14]
#
# 1. Write a function `average_distance(dist_list)` that returns the average weekly distance.
# 2. Write `above_target(dist_list, target=15)` that returns the total km run above the target distance.
# 3. Store these functions in `training_utils.py` and show how to import them into your script.
# 4. Test both functions on the dataset.
